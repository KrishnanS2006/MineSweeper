# MineSweeper

Play the classic Mine Sweeper game in Python, using Pygame. Hope you enjoy!

## Inspiration
[Tech With Tim's Coding Challenge](https://youtu.be/RRYgc4YIhEs)

*Before watching the challenge video, I challenged myself to create the game as well. I didn't time myself; however, I'd estimate about 2 hours taken to finish coding this project.*

*Some edits were made after watching TechWithTim's video, to fix some edge-cases I had not been aware of.*
